This is a python script to move the cursor in a square when the mouse is clicked once, and subsequently move whenever a key on the keyboard is pressed.

Place in the startup folder of a friends computer (of course don't do anything illegal or anything that may get them mad at you) and have some fun!

Tested on Windows 7 x64 SP1 with Python 2.7.3 x86
